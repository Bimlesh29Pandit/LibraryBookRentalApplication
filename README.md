# 📚 Online Book Rental System

This is a Spring Boot-based RESTful web application for managing an online book rental system. It allows users to browse books, rent them (with limits), and return them. It features role-based access, JWT authentication, and MySQL persistence.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Spring Security (JWT & Role-Based)**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL**
- **ModelMapper**
- **Lombok**
- **Maven**

---

## ✅ Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based access control using Spring Security.
- Two roles supported: `ADMIN`, `USER`.

### Users

- Register and login.
- Fetch profile details.
- Role: `USER` (by default), `ADMIN` (for admin operations).

### Books (Accessible by ADMIN and USER)

- `GET /books` — View all available books (USER/ADMIN).
- `POST /books` — Add a new book (ADMIN only).
- `PUT /books/{id}` — Update book details (ADMIN only).
- `DELETE /books/{id}` — Delete a book (ADMIN only).

### Rentals

- `POST /rent/{bookId}` — Rent a book (USER only).
  - ❗ Users **cannot rent more than 2 books** at the same time.
  - Only books that are not returned yet count towards the limit.
- `PUT /return/{rentalId}` — Return a rented book (USER only).
- `GET /rentals` — View rental history of logged-in user (USER).
- `GET /rentals/all` — View all rentals (ADMIN).

## 🛡️ Security Configuration

- Custom JWT token generation and validation.
- Filter chain configured with:

  - `/auth/*` → Open to all (register/login).
  - `/books` (GET) → USER & ADMIN.
  - `/books` (POST/PUT/DELETE) → ADMIN only.
  - `/rent/*` → USER only.

Example endpoint permission:

```java
.requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/books").hasAnyRole("ADMIN", "USER")
.requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/books/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
```

---

## 🔑 Authentication

Use the `/auth/login` endpoint to get a JWT token:

```json
POST /auth/login
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourPassword"
}
```

Then add the token in headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

---

## 🚫 Business Logic Constraints

- A user can **hold a maximum of 2 books** at a time.
- User must **return a book** before renting a third.
- Rental logic checks `returned == false` to determine active rentals.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bimlesh29Pandit/LibraryBookRentalApplication.git
cd book-rental-system
```

### 2. Configure MySQL

Update `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bookrental
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## 🧪 Sample Test Users

### Admin User

```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "admin123",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```
